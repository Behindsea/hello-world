# Python之禅
作者：Tim Peters

原文：
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than \*right\* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

译文：

- 漂亮优于丑陋
- 明确优于含蓄
- 简单优于复杂
- 复杂优于难懂
- 扁平优于嵌套
- 稀疏优于密集
- 强调可读性
- 特殊情况并非特殊到足以打破规则
- 虽然实用性胜过纯净
- 但是错误也不应该无声无息略过
- 除非是确定地忽略
- 面对模棱两可的情况下，拒绝猜测的诱惑
- 应当有一个，并且最好只有一个，明确的方式完成它
- 尽管那种方式可能一开始并不明显，除非你是荷兰人
- 已实现比纯计划更好
- 尽管纠正现状还不如没有开始
- 如果实现方式很难说明，它就是个坏主意
- 如果实现方式很容易说明，那它可能是个好主意
- 命名空间是一个伟大的想法，让我们更多的使用它吧！
